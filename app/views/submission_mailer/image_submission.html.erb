<h3>Thank you for contributing to the GoVerse Image Library.</h3><br/>

<p>Every image we receive is moderated by a team member at TMCYouth before it is published to our global GoVerse community. We select images based on a range of criteria. Generally we are looking for fresh high-quality imagery. Don't forget to submit landscape and portrait images, each are handled separately.</p>

<p>Stay tuned - in the next month we will be aggregating all of your image submissions (by email) in your own GoVerse Gallery for everyone to browse. This will be available at: www.time4thinkers.com/goverse</p>

<p>You may contact us at app@goverse.org for more information.</p>
<p>And please, continue to contribute!</p>
