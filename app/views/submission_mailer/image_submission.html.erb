Thank you for contributing to the GoVerse Image Library.

Every image we receive is moderated by a team member at TMCYouth before it is published to our global GoVerse community. We select images based on a range of criteria. Generally we are looking for fresh high-quality imagery. Don't forget to submit landscape and portrait images, each are handled separately.

Stay tuned - in the next month we will be aggregating all of your image submissions (by email) in your own GoVerse Gallery for everyone to browse. This will be available at: www.time4thinkers.com/goverse

You may contact us at app@goverse.org for more information.
And please, continue to contribute!
